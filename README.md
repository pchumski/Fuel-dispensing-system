# Fuel-dispensing-system
The aim of the project was to implement a fuel dispensing system using Tia Portal program via Web Server of the controller. This system should have an intuitive and transparent user and administrator interface and allow the administrator to browse the list of users and add user entries for nighttime fuel dispensing at the station. The user should be able to refuel using the web server page as well as have contact information in case of problems or access to their data. The user and admin have a unique ID, login, and password assigned.
